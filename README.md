## Article I Found：
[What Is Software Engineering?](https://www.mtu.edu/cs/undergraduate/software/what/)

## Reasons:
This article clearly explains that software engineering is not just about writing code, but about designing, testing, maintaining, and improving software systems over time. I found it useful because it emphasizes problem-solving, teamwork, and long-term thinking rather than just programming skills.

Also, I liked how it distinguishes software engineering from computer science by focusing on real-world applications and engineering practices. This helped me better understand what to expect from a software engineering course and how it connects to building reliable and scalable systems.

## Takeaway
It helped me better understand how software engineering emphasizes reliability, collaboration, and long-term maintenance rather than just writing code.
